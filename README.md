## sample_pubsub
Sample code and configuration to get easily started with creating ROS pubsub nodes  
  
####**_Installing & Building_**  
  
  

Make sure ROS is properly installed on your machine by follow these instructions:

http://gcc-robotics.github.io/robot-motion-planning-labs/lab0-setting-up/

**A. Create Catkin workspace in your home directory:**  

``` 
  mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src  
```  

**B. Initialize the workspace:**  

```  
  $ cd ~/catkin_ws/src  
  $ catkin_init_workspace  
  $ cd ~/catkin_ws  
  $ catkin_make  
```  
  
**C. Load the proper environment:**  

``` 
  $ source devel/setup.bash  
```  

**D. Verify that your workspace is in ROS's path:**  

``` 
  $ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH  
```  
  *YOU SHOULD SEE: /home/YOUR_USER_NAME/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks*  


**E. Clone the sample code from GitHub**  

``` 
  $ cd ~/catkin_ws/src  
  $ git clone https://github.com/khanoyan/sample_pubsub.git  
``` 

**F. Build the code. Note that there's currently a bug that requires running
   catkin_make TWICE. The first time it'll throw an error. Second time it'll
   work. This has to do with dependencies not being properly configured.**
```    
  $ cd ~/catkin_ws  
  $ catkin_make  
  $ catkin_make  
```
